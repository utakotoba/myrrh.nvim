### myrrh.nvim

Myrrh is _yet another_ Everforest-like colorscheme, subtly tweaked for immersion and peace. Visually, it closely resembles [Everforest](https://github.com/sainnhe/everforest) but offers a darker background (darker than Everforest's Dark preset), milder colors, and minimal visual distraction.

The intent is __not__ to create a fancy, cool, or post-modern color style, __nor__ is it to make any element _overly_ eye-catching. I tried to give it a "flat" visual feeling to stop your sight from jumping around the code.

### Status

Myrrh is currently in an __experimental stage__. Color choices and their contextual usage are still under real-world testing. Until version __v1.0__, expect adjustments and refinements without prior notice.

> It could not be used as for now. I'm working to finish the highlight settings in few days.

### Naming

The name __Myrrh__ is inspired by the character _Myrrh_ from the mobile anime game _Arknights_. I found her color palette unexpectedly similar to Everforest’s, but with what felt like a more soothing visual balance. This project’s name acknowledges that inspiration from her design and tone.
